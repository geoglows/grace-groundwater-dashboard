//      deployment moves, so they are hard-coded (overridable via env).
//   2. Everything this app ships is resolved through asset(), which prefixes
//      Vite's base path.
//
// A bare leading-slash path ("/aquifers.geojson") is always a bug: it resolves
// against the *origin* root, so it works in dev and at a root deployment and
// silently 404s — or, behind CloudFront, 503s — the moment the app is served
// from a sub-path like /portal/grace/.

// Vite substitutes this at build time with the resolved `base` from
// vite.config.js, always normalized with a trailing slash.

// half degree store is opt-in (the "half degree water balance cells" setting,
